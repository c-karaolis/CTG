                    Entertainment is only one of the many benefits of playing modern board
                    games.</x-activities.paragraph>
                <x-activities.paragraph>
                    Board games promote active learning, building memory and essential cognitive skills such as
                    reasoning
                    and logic, strategy, critical-thinking, creativity, problem-solving and self-reflection, decision
                    making, collaboration and healthy competition.</x-activities.paragraph>
                <x-activities.paragraph>
                    They offer opportunities for social connections and face-to-face interaction, away from mobile
                    phones
                    and tablets, computer and TV screens. Playing board games reduces stress and brings us closer to
                    friends, family, children and grandparents.

                    Guests can choose to borrow and play from a rich library of board games that includes fun and
                    educational games for young children, collaborative and competitive games with a wide selection of
                    themes and mechanics for teenagers and adults, as well as quick to play and learn party games,
                    suitable
                    for beginners.</x-activities.paragraph>
                <x-activities.paragraph>
                    Other than the games in our library, guests are able to bring their own games from home and sit down
                    and
                    play in the Open Gaming Area at their own pace and leisure. Whether meeting up with friends to play,
                    or
                    hoping to make new ones at the event, we provide our guests with ample space to get together and
                    play.</x-activities.paragraph>
