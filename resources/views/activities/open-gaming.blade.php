                    We get it, sometimes you just want to sit down and play your favourite game or the game you just
                    bought! At our Open Gaming Area, there is ample seating space where guests can form their own groups
                    to play games from their collection, or join impromptu gaming groups looking for more players.

                    Open gaming is an excellent way to meet new like-minded people, make friends and immerse yourself in
                    the communal aspect of tabletop gaming.

                    Alternatively, playtesting one of the prototype games brought by local game designers is another
                    great way to participate and contribute to the local tabletop gaming community. Refer to the
                    Playtesting schedule for more information on the games being playtested and the time they will be
                    showcased.

                    Our Playtesting zone is designed to offer game designers and members of the public the opportunity
                    to test new tabletop games that are still in the early stages of their production.

                <x-activities.paragraph>
                    Designers can book a playtesting slot to bring their roleplaying, board game or card game prototypes
                    and collect feedback from everyone who plays their game.
                </x-activities.paragraph>

                <x-activities.paragraph>
                    Playtesting is incredibly important for game designers, as it allows them to better understand
                    player experience, collect valuable feedback to help them develop their game further, and discover
                    potential areas for improvement by observing and comparing player behaviour against
                    designer-intended mechanics.
                </x-activities.paragraph>

                <x-activities.paragraph>
                    Additionally, playtesting provides game designers visibility and direct exposure to their target
                    audience.

                <x-activities.paragraph>
                    Guests are given the opportunity to play new games before they are published, provide their input,
                    and maybe be given playtesting credits for their contribution.
