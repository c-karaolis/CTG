                    Playing tabletop roleplaying games is a fun and creative way to engage in collaborative
                    storytelling, by assuming the role of unique fantasy characters and experiencing a rich and vibrant
                    imaginary world through their eyes.</x-activities.paragraph>

                    The inherent benefits of tabletop roleplaying are many: they help us learn how to take the
                    perspective of others, as well as learn about consequences and decision making. They help to boost
                    our creativity and imagination, improve our mental health and aid in the development of literacy and
                    maths skills. Additionally, tabletop RPGs encourage and develop teamwork and provide a safe
                    environment for children and adults alike to combat their shyness and improve their social
                    skills.</x-activities.paragraph>
